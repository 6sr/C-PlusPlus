//Farmer John has built a new long barn, with N (2 <= N <= 100,000) stalls. The stalls are located along a straight line at
//positions x1,â€¦,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000).

//His C (2 <= C <= N) cows don't like this barn layout and become aggressive towards each other once put into a stall.
//To prevent the cows from hurting each other, FJ wants to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance 
//between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?
