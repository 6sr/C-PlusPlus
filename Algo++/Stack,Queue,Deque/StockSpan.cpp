/*
The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of N daily price quotes for a stock and we need to calculate span
of stockâ€™s price for all N days. You are given an array of length N, where ith element of array denotes the price of a stock on ith.
Find the span of stock's price on ith day, for every 1<=i<=N.
A span of a stock's price on a given day, i, is the maximum number of consecutive days before the (i+1)th day, for which stock's price
on these days is less than or equal to that on the ith day. */
